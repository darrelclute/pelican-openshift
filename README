====================
Pelican on OpenShift
====================

This is a base repository you can utilize to host your Pelican based site on OpenShift.  With this setup you do not have to worry about building your site locally and then pushing it up, you simply push to OpenShift and your site will build there.

Deploy a Python cartridge to your OpenShift account and you can utilize this as the template of building out your content.

The build script is setup so that you will pull the theme you are using via Git instead of maintaining it with your OpenShift repository.  To change themes edit the 'git clone' lines in .openshift/action_hooks/build.

All other configuration data is stored in the conf directory, this includes Apache configuration and Pelican configuration.

The data directory is the expected location for all of your content, place your Markdown or reStructuredText sources here.

If you are utilizing any of the pelican plugins add the appropriate plugins to the requires in setup.py.
